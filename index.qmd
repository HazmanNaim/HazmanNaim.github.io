  <h2>Current Update</h2>
  
  <p><strong>August 3, 2023:</strong> I discovered the <a href="https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships">Forage</a>, which offers job simulations from over 200 of the world’s leading companies. I applied for the KPMG AU Virtual Internship Program, which provides a virtual job simulation as a Data Analyst at KPMG AU. As a Data Analyst, I analyzed transaction datasets and recommended that companies target specific customer segments. I learned a lot from the Forage Virtual Internship Program. It was a valuable experience that allowed me to gain practical skills and knowledge in the field of data analysis. </p>
  
  <p><strong>July 7, 2023:</strong>  I have recently joined Kaggle, the world’s largest data science community. This platform provides me with the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with other data scientists, as well as participate in exciting machine learning competitions. I am eager to explore all that Kaggle has to offer and continue to grow in my data science journey. Join me on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hazmannaim">Kaggle</a> and let's go explore our data science journey together.</p>

  <p><strong>June 10, 2023:</strong> I have recently enrolled in the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science">IBM Data Science Professional Certificate</a> program on Coursera. This program will provide me with the opportunity to enhance my skills and knowledge in the field of data science, and I am looking forward to the learning journey ahead.</p>
