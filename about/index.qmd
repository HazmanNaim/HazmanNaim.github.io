# About

Welcome to my profile! I am Hazman Naim Bin Ahsan, a graduate of the University of Malaya with a Bachelor of Science in Physics.

My interests are diverse, ranging from the natural sciences, including physics and mathematics, to technology, such as AI and Machine Learning. I am particularly drawn to the AI field, which includes computer vision, generative modeling, and NLP. I firmly believe that artificial intelligence has the potential to transform the world for the better, provided it is used ethically.

I am also a proficient Python programmer, experienced in developing programs with Python. Additionally, I pride myself on being a detailed and organized individual. I always track everything I do and ensure that I document all aspects of my projects. For this purpose, I always utilize Git and Github. Furthermore, I am an advocate for open-source initiatives and have contributed to several projects on Github. One of my proudest contributions was providing training data for the first [Malaysian LLM by Mesolitica](https://github.com/mesolitica/malaysian-dataset).

I have a passion for continuous learning, particularly in the field of AI. This is why I dedicate a significant amount of my time to platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/).

In my leisure time, I enjoy participating in competitive AI/ML activities, many of which are hosted on Kaggle. I have also engaged in competitions, such as my first AI competition, "[SenNet + HOA - Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/blood-vessel-segmentation)," where the objective was to segment the vasculature system of the human kidney from 3D scans. Currently, I am involved in the "[Storm Damage Assessment](https://challenge.ey.com/challenges)" an open data science competition by EY. In this competition, I participate in a group, aiming to assess damaged infrastructure during storm events.

My journey has been fueled by a passion for AI, a dedication and a commitment to continuous learning. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in the ever-evolving landscape of technology. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hazmannaim/)!

# Interests

In addition to my work as an AI Developer, I have a passion for astrophotography. I own a computerized telescope that is specifically designed for astrophotography. I capture images of deep sky objects, planets, and galaxies. I share these images on my Facebook page. I also enjoy participating in astronomy outreach programs. Recently, I had the opportunity to serve as a telescope operator for the Kuala Kubu Bharu Starfest 2023, which was organized by Majlis Daerah Hulu Selangor in collaboration with Sahabat Langit Utara.
