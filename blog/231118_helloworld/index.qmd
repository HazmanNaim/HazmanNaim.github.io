Over the past few months, my homepage served as a placeholder for my porfolio.
As I have interest in learning and sharing knowledge, I have chosen to utilize this platform to document my data science journey.
And now, here we are.

I want to express my gratitude to Murthadza Aznam, also known as [\@Thaza_kun](https://twitter.com/Thaza_Kun) on Twitter, for introducing me to the amazing Quarto project. Be sure to explore his [homepage](https://thaza-kun.github.io/) as well!
Special thanks to the Quarto project for enabling this journey. Setting everything up took just a matter of hours.

As I aspire to become a data scientist and AI engineer, my plan is to consistently publish valuable, insightful, and thought-provoking blog posts. Cheers!
