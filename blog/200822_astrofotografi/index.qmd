Astrophotography is a method that applies photography techniques to produce images of celestial objects. The intended celestial objects are those in the sky, such as the moon, the sun, planets, stars, and galaxies. Capturing these celestial objects is not as simple as taking pictures of our surroundings; it's not just a matter of pressing the camera button and getting a picture. Specialized photography skills are required to produce high-quality images of celestial objects.

The celestial objects we often see at night appear dim because the amount of light that reaches our eyes is minimal. Don't believe it? Try going outside and observe the night sky. We cannot clearly see the stars for a moment until our eyes adjust to the dark conditions; only then can we see the stars. This dim light makes observing celestial objects challenging.

Before the invention of digital cameras, astronomers observed celestial objects using various specialized methods. One of them is the daguerreotype method introduced by a French photographer named Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre. This method involved exposing a copper plate coated with silver iodide to a source of light and then creating an image through a chemical reaction involving mercury and salt solution. The first lunar image was produced in 1840 using this technique.

Before the invention of digital cameras, capturing images of celestial objects was extremely difficult and required a deep understanding of the techniques involved. Now, the process has become easier and does not require complex techniques. Anyone who has a camera and a basic understanding of how to use it can capture images of celestial objects.

The basic technique in astrophotography is called long exposure. This technique involves exposing the camera sensor to light for a longer period of time. Dim objects like celestial objects are suitable for this technique. The camera sensor is exposed to the celestial object for a certain duration so that enough light is gathered to produce the image.

To control the amount of light in the image, there are several camera settings that need to be adjusted. They include ISO, shutter speed, and aperture.

ISO is a setting that determines the sensitivity of the camera sensor to light. The higher the ISO, the more sensitive the camera sensor is to light.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="2.jpg" style="width: 50%; object-fit: contain; box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.3); border: 1px solid black;"/>

```

Shutter speed is a setting that determines how quickly the aperture opens to allow light to enter. The slower the shutter speed, the more light enters the camera.

```{=html}
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="3.jpg" style="width: 50%; object-fit: contain; box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.3); border: 1px solid black;"/>

```

Aperture, on the other hand, is a setting that determines the size of the lens opening that allows light to enter. The larger the aperture, the more light can enter.

```{=html}
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="4.jpg" style="width: 50%; object-fit: contain; box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.3); border: 1px solid black;"/>

These three settings are the most fundamental aspects of astrophotography. If we can control these settings effectively, the quality of the captured images will be better. To become proficient in astrophotography, I have made it a hobby, and the experiences gained while engaging in this field are truly valuable.
