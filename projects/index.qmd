This project is a machine learning project we tackled in the Kaggle Playground Competition---a category of competition on Kaggle designed for short machine learning tasks. Our goal was to predict if someone is a smoker based on bio-signals, working within the constraints of this competition. I led a team of two collaborators, and our solution landed us in the top 28%, outperforming 1908 teams globally. Since the Kaggle Playground Competition provides a pre-cleaned dataset, we focused on building models with high ROC-AUC scores for predicting smoking status. We tried out different algorithms, like logistic regression, random forest, and tree-boosted algorithms such as gradient boost, histogram-based gradient boost, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost.To boost accuracy and reduce model variability, we created a weighted-voting ensemble. This ensemble combined the three best-performing algorithms we selected after careful evaluation. Our ensemble model proved to be more accurate in predicting smoking status compared to each individual model. We fine-tuned our models using Optuna, a tool known for efficiently finding the best hyperparameters. This tuning process led to a final submission with a ROC-AUC score of 0.87178. While this score was slightly below the top submission's 0.87946, our approach showcased strong predictive abilities and highlighted the importance of algorithm choices and ensemble methods while minimizing model variance.
