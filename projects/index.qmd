            <h3>Machine Learning Classification of Building Damage in Post-Storm Event Assessment </h3>
            <p>This competition requires participants to prepare the dataset from satellite images of San Juan pre- and post-storm. With this dataset, participants are required to classify each building in the validation dataset into one of four categories: undamaged residential buildings, damaged residential buildings, undamaged commercial buildings, and damaged commercial buildings.</p>
