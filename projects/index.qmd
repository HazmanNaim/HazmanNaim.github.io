This is the project as part of the EY Open Science Data Challenge competition. This competition requires participants to prepare the dataset from satellite images of San Juan pre- and post-storm. With this dataset, participants are required to train a machine learning model and classify each building in the validation dataset into one of four categories: undamaged residential buildings, damaged residential buildings, undamaged commercial buildings, and damaged commercial buildings.
