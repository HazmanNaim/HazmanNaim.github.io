This project is a machine learning project that we conducted for the Kaggle Playground Competition, a category of competition on Kaggle that offers short machine learning challenges. The objective of this competition was to predict the smoking status of individuals based on their bio-signals, such as systolic, cholesterol level, blood sugar, and etc. We formed a team of three members, including myself as the team leader, and we achieved a rank of 28% among 1908 teams globally. The competition provided a pre-processed dataset, so we focused on developing models with high ROC-AUC scores, which measure the ability to discriminate between smokers and non-smokers. We experimented with various algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forest, and tree-based boosting methods, including gradient boost, histogram-based gradient boost, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost. To improve AUC-ROC score and reduce variance, we created a weighted-voting ensemble that combined the three best-performing algorithms that we selected after rigorous evaluation. Our ensemble model outperformed each individual model in predicting smoking status. We fine-tuned our models using Optuna, a framework for hyperparameter optimization, to find the optimal values for each parameter. This tuning process resulted in a final submission with a ROC-AUC score of 0.87178. Although this score was slightly lower than the top submission’s 0.87946, our approach demonstrated strong predictive power and emphasized the importance of algorithm selection and ensemble techniques for reducing model variance.
