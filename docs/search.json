My final year project, “Studies on Bipolar Outflows in Star Forming Region AFGL 5142 with ALMA,” was supervised by a prominent Malaysian radio astronomer, Prof. Dr. Zamri Bin Zainal Abidin. In this project, I analyzed ALMA archival data to investigate the outflows from the AFGL 5142 star forming region. I utilized radio spectroscopy to observe the line emission of 13C17O and detect the bipolar outflows through redshifted and blueshifted emissions. Furthermore, I calculated the properties of the outflows such as mass, momentum, and energy, and proposed that they may have played a role in promoting star formation in neighboring regions. I processed the data using CASA, the primary software for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and further analyzed the data using Python with Astropy and AplPy packages. I was also honored to work with professional astronomers in the Radio Cosmology Research Laboratory.My research project earned me the Best Presentation Award from the Department of Physics at University of Malaya, reflecting my dedication and hard work. My experience in this project has honed my skills and broadened my knowledge in the field of radio astronomy."

    "title": "The Story Behind My Fascination with Data Science",
    "section": "",
    "text": "My interest in data science was sparked during my undergraduate studies, where my passion for astronomy and astrophysics played a significant role. For my final year project, I focused on the topic of radio astronomy. Specifically, I conducted research on the properties of bipolar outflows and mapped their dynamics using 13C170 molecular line emission in the star forming region AFGL5142 in the constellation Auriga. In the field of radio astronomy, it is common practice to employ line emission as a means to map the structures of outflows, as well as dust clouds and specific regions. This approach allows us to penetrate the thick clouds of dust and gases, which often obscure the fascinating activities occurring during star formation. By utilizing molecular line emission as a tracer, we gain insights into these hidden processes.\n\n  \n  Celebrating the completion of my thesis with my supportive mentor.\n\nAstrophysics research generates vast amounts of data. Consider the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), the largest radio telescope in the world, which produces over an Exabyte of data on a daily basis. A typical sky survey archive contains around 10 terabytes of image data and billions of detected sources, including stars, galaxies, and quasars. Each source is associated with hundreds of measured attributes. These surveys cover a wide range of wavelengths, from radio to gamma rays, and represent just a glimpse of the immense datasets yet to come. With each passing year, advancements in electronics lead to the introduction of new instruments that double the amount of data collected, resulting in the exponential growth of astronomical information. Consequently, we can anticipate datasets that are orders of magnitude larger, more complex, and more homogeneous than those of the past. To put it into perspective, the size of the human genome is approximately 1 gigabyte, while the Library of Congress contains about 20 terabytes of data. Undoubtedly, astronomy has entered the era of big data.\nMy interest in astronomy and astrophysics played a crucial role in steering me towards the field of data science. I have always been fascinated by the vastness of the cosmos and the mysteries it holds. However, it was through my exploration of astronomical data that I realized the power and potential of data science.\nOne aspect that drew me to data science is the opportunity to work with massive datasets. I find great excitement in delving into large volumes of data, knowing that within them lie hidden patterns, correlations, and insights waiting to be discovered. Data science enables us to uncover knowledge that was previously unknown, pushing the boundaries of our understanding.\nWhile astronomy and astrophysics would have been a natural career path for me, I chose to pursue data science because I believe it offers me the chance to apply my knowledge and skills in diverse fields. I wanted to leverage my understanding of data analysis and programming beyond the realm of astrophysics. My introduction to programming and computer knowledge during my astrophysics studies laid a strong foundation for me to transition into the field of data science seamlessly. For me, embarking on a journey in data science represents a continuation of my learning and growth.\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of data science is its ability to bridge distant fields together. Data scientists possess a unique skill set that allows them to analyze and interpret data from various domains. This interdisciplinary nature of data science enables connections to be made between seemingly unrelated fields, fostering collaborations and generating new insights. By immersing myself in the world of data science, I am excited to explore the convergence of different disciplines and contribute to the advancement of knowledge.\nIn summary, my passion for astronomy and astrophysics initially sparked my interest in data science. The allure of working with big data, the opportunity to discover hidden insights, the desire to apply my knowledge beyond a single field, and the ability to bridge distant domains together all motivate me to pursue a career as a data scientist. I am eager to embark on this journey and contribute to the exciting and ever-evolving field of data science."

    "title": "Orion, The Night Hunter",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Did you know that if you look towards the sky at night between the months of November and February, there are three bright stars in a straight line directly above your head? Among the millions of stars in the night sky, these three stars are the most significant and captivating to our eyes. This group of stars is part of the constellation known as Orion.\n\n  \n  Orion image by author.\n\nThe constellation Orion is famous in the night sky due to its relatively large size and easy identification when observed. Furthermore, the geographical location of our country, being close to the equator, causes the Orion constellation to be directly overhead. In astronomical terms, this position is called the zenith. The zenith is a position in the celestial sphere where an object is directly above the observer.\nThe name Orion originates from Greek mythology. Orion was a renowned hunter. After his death, Zeus transformed Orion into a constellation that adorns the night sky. In reality, there are many variations of the Orion myth, but one is enough to be shared.\n\n  \n  Orion constellation is Stellarium software.\n\nThe Orion constellation consists of seven main stars that are brighter than the others. Three stars named Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka form a straight line when viewed from Earth. They can be imagined as the hunter’s belt. In Malay culture, these three stars are referred to as the Bintang Tiga Beradik (Three Siblings Stars). Look slightly below, and you will notice three smaller stars that form what appears to be a sword placed by the hunter’s side. That is where the famous Orion Nebula, is located. The Orion Nebula is a nebula composed of interstellar dust clouds and gas. It serves as a birthplace for new stars.\n\n  \n  Features in Orion constellation.\n\n\n  \n  Photograph of Orion Nebula taken using amateur astrophotography equipments. Source: www.astrobackyard.com\n\nThere are many more fascinating celestial objects in the Orion constellation. Besides the Orion Nebula, there are several other notable nebulae, including the Horsehead Nebula and the Flame Nebula. These three nebulae are famous and ideal for telescope observation for those who are new to the field of astronomy. Additionally, there is Barnard’s Loop, an emission nebula in the form of a loop surrounding the Orion constellation. This nebula is somewhat challenging to observe with the naked eye, except in very dark locations or through astrophotography.\nAstrophotography is a highly enjoyable activity as it allows you to capture images of celestial objects that are not visible to the naked eye.\nFor the author, the Orion constellation is highly captivating to observe in the night sky. Its zenith position and large size provide advantages for viewing this constellation. It is no wonder that the Orion constellation attracts astronomy enthusiasts and astrophotographers due to its numerous fascinating features. If you are new to the world of astronomy, the Orion constellation is a must-know constellation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Astrophotography is a method that applies photography techniques to produce images of celestial objects. The intended celestial objects are those in the sky, such as the moon, the sun, planets, stars, and galaxies. Capturing these celestial objects is not as simple as taking pictures of our surroundings; it’s not just a matter of pressing the camera button and getting a picture. Specialized photography skills are required to produce high-quality images of celestial objects.\nThe celestial objects we often see at night appear dim because the amount of light that reaches our eyes is minimal. Don’t believe it? Try going outside and observe the night sky. We cannot clearly see the stars for a moment until our eyes adjust to the dark conditions; only then can we see the stars. This dim light makes observing celestial objects challenging.\nBefore the invention of digital cameras, astronomers observed celestial objects using various specialized methods. One of them is the daguerreotype method introduced by a French photographer named Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre. This method involved exposing a copper plate coated with silver iodide to a source of light and then creating an image through a chemical reaction involving mercury and salt solution. The first lunar image was produced in 1840 using this technique.\n\n  \n  First photograph of the moon taken using daguerreotype by Luis-Jacques-Mandé in 1840. Source: time.com\n\nBefore the invention of digital cameras, capturing images of celestial objects was extremely difficult and required a deep understanding of the techniques involved. Now, the process has become easier and does not require complex techniques. Anyone who has a camera and a basic understanding of how to use it can capture images of celestial objects.\nThe basic technique in astrophotography is called long exposure. This technique involves exposing the camera sensor to light for a longer period of time. Dim objects like celestial objects are suitable for this technique. The camera sensor is exposed to the celestial object for a certain duration so that enough light is gathered to produce the image.\nTo control the amount of light in the image, there are several camera settings that need to be adjusted. They include ISO, shutter speed, and aperture.\nISO is a setting that determines the sensitivity of the camera sensor to light. The higher the ISO, the more sensitive the camera sensor is to light.\n\n  \n  Comparison of images taken with different ISO settings. Source: aws.amazon.com\n\nShutter speed is a setting that determines how quickly the aperture opens to allow light to enter. The slower the shutter speed, the more light enters the camera.\n\n  \n  Comparison of images taken with different shutter speed settings. Source: bhphotovideo.com\n\nAperture, on the other hand, is a setting that determines the size of the lens opening that allows light to enter. The larger the aperture, the more light can enter.\n\n  \n  Comparison of images taken with different aperture settings. Source: photographylife.com\n\nThese three settings are the most fundamental aspects of astrophotography. If we can control these settings effectively, the quality of the captured images will be better. To become proficient in astrophotography, I have made it a hobby, and the experiences gained while engaging in this field are truly valuable."

    "title": "Why doesn’t the International Space Station fall?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Scientific exploration is progressing rapidly day by day. Since the 20th century, humans have witnessed various achievements that surpass the limits of ordinary human capabilities. The advancement of science continues to thrive due to the innate curiosity within humans. For example, in the field of astronomy, in the past, humans could only observe stars during the night. However, today it is recorded in history that humans have landed on the moon for the first time. Previously, humans were confined to the Earth’s surface, but now we have a space station that serves as a habitat for humans, orbiting around the Earth. Have you ever wondered how the International Space Station (ISS) can remain in orbit for extended periods without falling back to Earth?\n\n  \n  International Space Station. Source: https://www.nasa.gov\n\nTo answer this question, let us go back to the time when Isaac Newton began to delve into the theory of gravity. In his famous work, “Treatise on the System of the World,” Isaac Newton conducted a thought experiment. What is a thought experiment? It is a mental analogy used to explain a hypothesis or, in simple terms, an experiment conducted solely using logical reasoning. In Newton’s thought experiment, he explored the motion of trajectories. A trajectory is the curved path followed by an object, such as a projectile, moving through space. Let’s take a cannonball as an example. When we fire a cannon, the cannonball is launched parallel to the Earth’s surface. The cannonball will then travel through the air, following a parabolic path, and eventually return to the surface due to the force of gravity and air resistance. Anything in the air will eventually fall to the ground.\n\n  \n  Portrait of Sir Isaac Newton. Source: http:// www.wikimedia.org\n\n\n  \n  Isaac Newton's works were recorded in his well-known book. Source: https://galileo.ou.edu\n\nThen, the cannon was fired again. This time, the velocity of the fired cannonball was increased. The higher the velocity at which the cannonball is fired, the farther the trajectory of the cannonball will be before it falls back to the surface. After that, the cannon was elevated to a higher altitude in the air. Why? To reduce the effect of air resistance on the trajectory of the cannonball. When we think deeply about it, if the air resistance is small enough to not significantly affect the trajectory of the cannonball, we can determine a velocity at which, when we fire the cannon and the cannonball travels at that velocity, the resulting trajectory will match the curvature of the Earth. Imagine the path of the cannonball starting to curve, and the Earth’s surface also curving. This means that the cannonball will not reach the ground because the curvature of the trajectory matches the curvature of the Earth.\n\n  \n  Three different trajectory of the cannonball. Source: https://i.stack.imgur.com\n\nThese three paths are differentiated by the velocity at which the cannonball travels through the air immediately after being fired. The faster the cannonball travels, the farther the trajectory will be. Trajectory C is the path in which the velocity of the cannonball allows it to continuously orbit around the Earth if there is no air resistance.\nTo answer the earlier question about the ISS, the ISS is actually falling. Yes, falling! In physics, we refer to it as freefall, which means falling solely due to gravity. However, because the ISS is moving at a specific velocity of approximately 7.66 km per second, this allows the trajectory of the ISS to precisely follow the curvature of the Earth’s surface. Since the ISS is technically falling, astronauts inside the space station experience weightlessness. When astronauts are weighed using a scale, the reading becomes zero. This weightless condition is continuously felt because the space station is falling at all times, but it never reaches the Earth’s surface.\nWe can create this weightless condition ourselves on the surface of the Earth. One way is when we are inside an elevator. If the elevator is dropped from a certain height, it will cause us to experience weightlessness, similar to being in space. However, there is no need to risk our lives by being inside a falling elevator. We can personally experience weightlessness by booking a ticket on a zero-g aircraft. These zero-g aircraft perform parabolic flights, where the weightless condition generated during the flight matches the conditions experienced in space.\n\n  \n  Weightless condition in an aircraft during parabolic flight.
